      " you're looking at this at this point in time in the spring, what you might want to consider. The DeWalt Flex Volt universal attachment string trimmer is a 60 volt tool. So it will not take 20 volt\n",
      "8\n",
      " batteries. You must be invested in the 60 volt platform. Not a big deal, small battery, but it does weigh quite a bit because it's 3P. So the balance of this unit is off. Although, when you're hanging onto it a little differently, it will work a little\n",
      "9\n",
      " bit better. With that said, it's a little bit shorter than many, so if you're taller you might find yourself bending over a little bit more. It's a 15 to 17 inch swath down here on the head end and the head that's down here, unfortunately is\n",
      "10\n",
      " not always as strong as some of the people using it. If you pound that head against the ground or against rocks, you'll find that it will break quite quickly. It is not expensive to replace with the DeWalt unit and it will take many other units that are out there. It is a speed close head\n",
      "11\n",
      " so you can easily put the line in it. But with that said, beat it against the ground a lot and you'll find yourself with parts laying all over the place. I've got a few friends with these and it happened to them quite quickly and you just have to learn if you're going to\n",
      "12\n",
      " keep that head to be fairly gentle with it. The second thing that maybe is a little bit annoying to many is going to be the safety. Now this trigger is probably the most gas-like feeling trigger out there but actually it doesn't work anything like a gas trigger. It's a stepped trigger. But\n",
      "13\n",
      " with that said the safety on the top, you have to push this lever over and then hold this down then you can pull the trigger, otherwise it's locked out. Great for throwing it in the back of a truck or something where you're piling it around other things, horrible for actually using it in the\n",
      "14\n",
      " yard. Last downside to this is run time. If you're really pushing this guy, run times are about 10 minutes with a 9 amp hour battery. That is like pushing it through solid heavy grass. If you're just using it normal household stuff, you can get 20 to \n",
      "15\n",
      "25 minutes out of it. The reason why this one landed at my house and not in our contractor trailer or in our lawn mowing trailer is that run time. Would have to carry two batteries in order to do the same amount of work I could do with a different machine with one battery. Is that because the motor\n",
      "16\n",
      " is up top and we have a shaft that runs through? I don't know. There is a lot of power here. Although the RPMs are lower, low is going to be around 4,000 RPMs and high on this is going to max out about 5800. But\n",
      "17\n",
      " with that said, because of the 17 inch swath you really get some great line speed going and this thing cuts like a beast. And secondly, it is butter smooth. You can use this thing all day if you wanted to and it feels great, it cuts great and there is zero vibrations felt up this grip\n",
      "18\n",
      ". This grip is purely DeWalt and once you get over that safety, you will absolutely love it. The stepped trigger, most people will get used to it, but when I say stepped trigger, it's not fully variable, it goes in different modes. And just watch my finger here and listen. As you\n",
      "19\n",
      " get closer to the top, it feels more variable but realistically, it's just taking different points and bumping that motor up as it goes through. That was not my finger just moving quickly through that. That was the steps as it goes through. Not a big deal, it's a little different than when if\n",

      " you're using gas and you're trying to use the different full variable speeds, simply doesn't have it. It's just got the steps. Either way, this is one unit that I've kept the .080 line on, simply because it works great. A lot of people bump\n",

      " up to the .095, I can see why. I do 99% of my stuff, but around home, I don't feel like I need it. And this thing really has great power. And again, the run time would suffer a little bit more if we upgraded to .09\n",

      "23\n",
      " the third one mostly, the battery is mostly dead and I'll run out of battery. So half the time, or a third, two thirds, whatever, I go out and I'll run this on low only because I'm trying to conserve battery. And around the house on low only, it does\n",
      "24\n",
      " awesome. It's one of the few units that I actually use the low on because I was forced to because I was kind of a dummy and didn't pull out the battery and charge it up. Overall this kit here, if you don't need super long run time and if you want some good power\n",
      "25\n",
      " and you have other attachments or you want to buy other attachments that are universal, an excellent buy. You will love the smoothness of it, you can easily pop a pin out here of that safety and the safety will be gone and it'll still be there but the little flip part that's annoying will be gone\n",

      "27\n",
      " And the 12 amp hour battery isn't going to add much more weight so why not. I think that would bump it up to the realm of where some of the other models are with lesser amp hour batteries. But this unit really has a lot to offer the homeowner who really wants to have a lot of\n",
      "28\n",
      " power and a lot of smoothness. I mean this really reminds me of my Steel when I'm out cutting with it, it is just butter smooth and really enjoyable to use. So after one year, I would still highly recommend this unit. Be careful with the head. Now the replacing that head is 30\n",

      "  \"full_transcript\": \"Almost a year ago exactly, Dewalt came out with their Flex Volt universal attachment string trimmer. Basically, that means this is a 60 volt power head that will take any attachment that is listed as universal. So if it's a universal Ryobi, a universal Dewalt, a universal whatever, it will take that and you'll be able to use it, which is pretty awesome for most people. I have used this as a string trimmer only. I'm going to go through what I deem is what this is really great as after year and what it kind of isn't as great as. And we'll go through if you're looking at this, at this point in time in the spring, what you might want to consider. The Dewalt Flex Bolt universal attachment string trimmer is a 60 volt tool, so it will not take 20 volt batteries. You must be invested in the 60 volt platform. Not a big deal. Small battery, but it does weigh quite a bit because it's three P. So the balance of this unit is off. Although when you're hanging onto it a little differently, it will work a little bit better. With that said, it's a little bit shorter than many, so if you're taller, you might find yourself bending over a little bit more. It's a 15 to 17 inch swath down here on the head end. And the head that's down here unfortunately is not always as strong as some of the people using it. If you pound that head against the ground or against rocks, you'll find that it will break quite quickly. It is not expensive to replace with the Dewalt unit and it will take many other units that are out there. It is a speed close head so you can easily put the line in it. But with that said, beat it against the ground a lot and you'll find yourself with parts laying all over the place. I've got a few friends with these and it happened to them quite quickly and you just have to learn if you're going to keep that head, to be fairly gentle with it. The second thing that maybe is a little bit annoying to many is going to be the safety. Now, this trigger is probably the most gas like feeling trigger out there, but actually it doesn't work anything like a gas trigger. It's a stepped trigger. But with that said, the safety on the top, you have to push this lever over and then hold this down then you can pull the trigger. Otherwise, it's locked out. Great for throwing it in the back of a truck or something where you're piling it around other things. Horrible for actually using it in the yard. Last downside to this is run time. If you're really pushing this guy, run times are about 10 minutes with a nine amp hour battery. That is like pushing it through solid heavy grass. If you're just using it normal household stuff, you can get 20 to 25 minutes out of it. The reason why this one landed at my house and not in our contractor trailer or in our lawn mowing trailer is that run time. We'd have to carry two batteries in order to do the same amount of work I could do with a different machine with one battery. Is that because the motor is up top and we have a shaft that runs through? I don't know. There is a lot of power here, although the RPMs are lower. Low is going to be around 4,000 RPMs and high on this is going to max out about 5,800. But with that said, because of the 17 inch swath, you really get some great line speed going and this thing cuts like a beast. And secondly, it is butter smooth. You can use this thing all day if you wanted to and it feels great, it cuts great, and there is zero vibrations felt up this grip. This grip is purely Dewalt and once you get over that safety, you will absolutely love it. The step trigger most people will get used to it, but when I say step trigger, it's not fully variable. It goes in different modes. And just watch my finger here and listen. As you get closer to the top, it feels more variable, but realistically it's just taking different points and bumping that motor up as it goes through. That was not my finger just moving quickly through that. That was the steps as it goes through. Not a big deal, it's a little different than when if you're using gas and you're trying to use the different full variable speeds, it simply doesn't have it. It's just got the steps. Either way, this is one unit that I've kept the .080 line on, simply because it works great. A lot of people bump up to the .095. I can see why. I do 99% of my stuff, but around home I don't feel like I need it. And this thing really has great power. And again, the run time would suffer a little bit more if we upgraded to .095 line. So I keep it at .080. Now, kicker of what at home because of the short run time, I I can really do two to three cuts around my yard based off of one battery. I don't need to trim that much. But what ends up happening is the last cut, the third one mostly, the battery's mostly dead and I'll run out of battery. So half the time, or a third, two thirds, whatever, I go out and I'll run this on low only because I'm trying to conserve battery. And around the house on low only, it does awesome. It's one of the few units that I actually use the low on because I was forced to because I'm kind of a dummy and didn't pull out the battery and charge it up. Overall, this kit here, if you don't need super long run time, and if you want some good power and you have other attachments or you want to buy other attachments that are universal, an excellent buy. You will love the smoothness of it. You can easily pop a pin out here of that safety and the safety will be gone and it'll still be there, but the little flip part that's annoying will be gone and you will love using this trimmer. It's simply a great trimmer that probably could use a little bit more run time or a little bit of uh, I'd hate to say put a 12 amp hour or 15 amp hour battery on this and you'd get great run time. You would. And the 12 amp hour battery isn't going to add much more weight, so why not? I think that would bump it up to the realm of where some of the other models are with lesser amp hour batteries. But this unit really has a lot to offer the homeowner who really wants to have a lot of power and a lot of smoothness. I mean this really reminds me of my steel when I'm out cutting with it. It is just butter smooth and really enjoyable to use. So after one year, I would still highly recommend this unit. Be careful with the head. Now the replacing that head is 30 bucks, but just be careful with it, don't beat on it and if something happens and it's not letting out line, take a look at it. And just don't continue beating on it. That's my take on this guy. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Please leave your comments below if you own this machine, if you have thoughts of buying it, or anything else.

      "  \"transcript\": \"Almost a year ago exactly, DeWalt came out with their Flex Volt universal attachment string trimmer. Basically, that means this is a 60 volt power head that will take any attachment that is listed as universal. So if it's a universal Ryobi, a universal DeWalt, universal whatever, it will take that and you'll be able to use it, which is pretty awesome for most people. I have used this as a string trimmer only. I'm gonna go through what I deem as what this is really great at after year and what it kind of isn't as great as. And we'll go through if you're looking at this at this point in time in the spring what you might want to consider. The DeWalt Flex Volt universal attachment string trimmer is a 60 volt tool, so it will not take 20 volt batteries. You must be invested in the 60 volt platform. Not a big deal, small battery, but it does weigh quite a bit because it's three P. So the balance of this unit is off, although when you're hanging onto it a little differently, it will work a little bit better. With that said, it's a little bit shorter than many, so if you're taller you might find yourself bending over a little bit more. It's a 15 to 17 inch swath down here on the head end. And the head that's down here unfortunately is not always as strong as some of the people using it. If you pound that head against the ground or against rocks, you'll find that it will break quite quickly. It is not expensive to replace with the DeWalt unit, and it will take many other units that are out there. It is a speed close head, so you can easily put the line in it. But with that said, beat it against the ground a lot and you'll find yourself with parts laying all over the place. I've got a few friends with these and it happened to them quite quickly, and you just have to learn if you're gonna keep that head, to be fairly gentle with it. The second thing that maybe is a little bit annoying to many is going to be this safety. Now this trigger is probably the most gas like feeling trigger out there, but actually it doesn't work anything like a gas trigger. It's a stepped trigger, but with that said the safety on the top, you have to push this lever over and then hold this down, then you can pull the trigger, otherwise it's locked out. Great for throwing it in the back of a truck or something where you're piling it around other things, horrible for actually using it in the yard. Last downside to this is run time. If you're really pushing this guy, run times are about 10 minutes with a 9 amp hour battery. That is like pushing it through solid heavy grass. If you're just using it in normal household stuff you can get 20 to 25 minutes out of it. The reason why this one landed at my house and not in our contractor trailer or in our lawn mowing trailer is that run time. Would have to carry two batteries in order to do the same amount of work I could do with a different machine with one battery. Is that because the motor is up top and we have a shaft that runs through, I don't know. There is a lot of power here, although the RPMs are lower. Low is going to be around 4,000 RPMs and high on this is going to max out about 5,800. But with that said, because of the 17 inch swath, you really get some great line speed going and this thing cuts like a beast. And secondly, it is butter smooth. You can use this thing all day if you wanted to and it feels great. It cuts great and there is zero vibrations felt up this grip. This grip is purely DeWalt and once you get over that safety, you will absolutely love it. The step trigger, most people will get used to it, but when I say step trigger, it's not fully variable. It goes in different modes and just watch my finger here and listen. As you get closer to the top, it feels more variable, but realistically it's just taking different points and bumping that motor up as it goes through. That was not my finger just moving quickly through that, that was the steps as it goes through. Not a big deal. It's a little different than when you're using gas and you're trying to use the different full variable speeds. It simply doesn't have it. It's just got the steps. Either way, this is one unit that I've kept the 0.080 line on, simply because it works great. A lot of people bump up to the 0.095, I can see why. I do a 99% of my stuff, but around home I don't feel like I need it. And this thing really has great power. And again, the run time would suffer a little bit more if we upgraded to 0.095 line, so I keep it at 0.08. Now kicker of what at home, because of the short run time, I can really do two to three cuts around my yard based off of one battery. I don't need to trim that much, but what ends up happening is the last cut, the third one mostly, the battery's mostly dead and I'll run out of battery. So half the time, or a third, two thirds, whatever, I go out and I'll run this on low only because I'm trying to conserve battery. And around the house on low only it does awesome. It's one of the few units that I actually use the low on because I was forced to because I'm kind of a dummy and didn't pull out the battery and charge it up. Overall, this kit here, if you don't need super long run time, and if you want some good power and you have other attachments, or you want to buy other attachments that are universal, an excellent buy. You will love the smoothness of it. You can easily pop a pin out here of that safety and the safety will be gone, and it'll still be there but the little flip part that's annoying will be gone. And you will love using this trimmer. Simply a great trimmer that probably could use a little bit more run time or a little bit of I'd hate to say put a 12 amp hour or a 15 amp hour battery on this and you'd get great run time. You would. And the 12 amp hour battery isn't gonna add much more weight so why not? I think that would bump it up to the realm of where some of the other models are with lesser amp hour batteries. But this unit really has a lot to offer the homeowner who really wants to have a lot of power and a lot of smoothness. I mean this really reminds me of my Stihl when I'm out cutting with it. It is just butter smooth and really enjoyable to use. So after one year, I would still highly recommend this unit. Be careful with the head. Now the replacing that head's 30 bucks, but just be careful with it. Don't beat on it, and if something happens and it's not letting out line, take a look at it. And just don't continue beating on it. That's my take on this guy. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Please leave your comments below. If you own this machine, if you have thoughts of buying it or anything else, it's always great to hear what other people have to say and a lot of people like to read that stuff and get your feedback also. We appreciate that. Give us a like on this video, subscribe to the channel if you haven't already. Thank you for your time. Have a great day.\"\n",

While it's powerful and smooth, it's shorter than some other models, and it doesn't accept 20-volt batteries. The balance of the unit is off but can be managed when you're hanging onto it. The head can break quickly if used aggressively against the ground or rocks. The trigger is described as gas-like but is actually a stepped trigger. It is very smooth with little to no vibrations. The safety is considered annoying but is useful for transport. The run time is approximately 10 minutes when pushing it hard and 20 to 25 minutes with normal use, using a 9-amp hour battery. A 12 amp hour battery would improve runtime without adding much more weight. The unit has a 15 to 17 inch swath and RPMs of 4000 to 5800. Overall, it's recommended for homeowners looking for power and smoothness. The reviewer suggests being gentle with the head and considering a higher amp battery for longer runtime. \",\n",

Basically, that means this is a 60-volt power head that will take any attachment that is listed as universal. So if it's a universal Ryobi, a universal Dewalt, a universal whatever, it will take that and you'll be able to use it, which is pretty awesome for most people. I have used this as a string trimmer only. I'm going to go through what I deem as what this is really great as after a year, and what it kind of isn't as great as. And we'll go through if you're looking at this at this point in time in the spring, what you might want to consider.\\n\\nThe Dewalt Flexvolt Universal attachment string trimmer is a 60-volt tool, so it will not take 20-volt batteries. You must be invested in the 60-volt platform. Not a big deal. Small battery, but it does weigh quite a bit because it's 3P. So the balance of this unit is off, although when you're hanging onto it a little differently, it will work a little bit better. With that said, it's a little bit shorter than many, so if you're taller, you might find yourself bending over a little bit more. It's a 15 to 17-inch swath down here on the head end. And the head that's down here, unfortunately, is not always as strong as some of the people using it. If you pound that head against the ground or against rocks, you'll find that it will break quite quickly. It is not expensive to replace with the Dewalt unit and it will take many other units that are out there. It is a speed close head, so you can easily put the line in it, but with that said, beat it against the ground a lot and you'll find yourself with parts laying all over the place. I've got a few friends with these and it happened to them quite quickly and you just have to learn if you're going to keep that head to be fairly gentle with it.\\n\\nThe second thing that maybe is a little bit annoying to many is going to be the safety. Now, this trigger is probably the most gas-like feeling trigger out there, but actually, it doesn't work anything like a gas trigger. It's a stepped trigger. But with that said, the safety on the top, you have to push this lever over and then hold this down, then you can pull the trigger. Otherwise, it's locked out. Great for throwing it in the back of a truck or something where you're piling it around other things, horrible for actually using it in the yard. Last downside to this is runtime. If you're really pushing this guy, runtimes are about 10 minutes with a 9 amp hour battery. That is like pushing it through solid, heavy grass. If you're just using it in normal household stuff, you can get 20 to 25 minutes out of it.\\n\\nThe reason why this one landed at my house and not in our contractor trailer or in our lawn mowing trailer is that runtime. Would have to carry two batteries in order to do the same amount of work I could do with a different machine with one battery. Is that because the motor is up top and we have a shaft that runs through? I don't know. There is a lot of power here, although the RPMs are lower. Low is going to be around 4,000 RPMs and high on this is going to max out about 5,800. But with that said, because of the 17-inch swath, you really get some great line speed going and this thing cuts like a beast.\\n\\nAnd secondly, it is butter smooth. You can use this thing all day if you wanted to and it feels great, it cuts great and there is zero vibrations felt up this grip. This grip is purely Dewalt and once you get over that safety, you will absolutely love it. The stepped trigger most people will get used to it, but when I say stepped trigger, it's not fully variable. It goes in different modes and just watch my finger here and listen.\\n\\nAs you get closer to the top, it feels more variable, but realistically it's just taking different points and bumping that motor up as it goes. That was not my finger just moving quickly through that. That was the steps as it goes through. Not a big deal. It's a little different than when if you're using gas and you're trying to use the different full variable speeds, it simply doesn't have it. It's just got the steps. Either way, this is one unit that I've kept the 0.080 line on, simply because it works great. A lot of people bump up to the 0.095, I can see why. I do on 99% of my stuff, but around home, I don't feel like I need it and this thing really has great power. And again, the runtime would suffer a little bit more if we upgraded to 0.095 line, so I keep it at 0.08.\\n\\nNow, kicker of what at home because of the short runtime, I can really do two to three cuts around my yard based off of one battery. I don't need to trim that much, but what ends up happening is the last cut, the third one mostly, the battery is mostly dead and I'll run out of battery. So half the time or a third, two-thirds, whatever, I go out and I'll run this on low only because I'm trying to conserve battery. And around the house on low only, it does awesome.\\n\\nIt's one of the few units that I actually use the low on because I was forced to because I was kind of a dummy and didn't pull out the battery and charge it up. Overall, this kit here, if you don't need super long runtime and if you want some good power and you have other attachments or you want to buy other attachments that are universal, an excellent buy. You will love the smoothness of it. You can easily pop a pin out here of that safety and the safety will be gone and it'll still be there, but the little flip part that's annoying will be gone and you will love using this trimmer. It's simply a great trimmer that probably could use a little bit more runtime or a little bit of uh I'd hate to say put a 12 amp hour or 15 amp hour battery on this and you'd get great runtime. You would. And the 12 amp hour battery isn't going to add much more weight, so why not? I think that would bump it up to the realm of where some of the other models are with lesser amp hour batteries.\\nBut this unit really has a lot to offer the homeowner who really wants to have a lot of power and a lot of smoothness. I mean, this really reminds me of my steel when I'm out cutting with it is just butter smooth and really enjoyable to use. So after one year, I would still highly recommend this unit. Be careful with the head. Now the replacing that head's 30 bucks, but just be careful with it, don't beat on it and if something happens and it's not letting out line, take a look at it and just don't continue beating on it.\\nThat's my take on this guy. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Please leave your comments below if you own this machine, if you have thoughts of buying it or anything else. It's always great to hear what other people have to say and a lot of people like to read that stuff and get your feedback also. We appreciate that.

    "                                    \"transcript\": \"Almost a year ago exactly, Dewalt came out with their Flex Bolt Universal attachment string trimmer. Basically, that means this is a 60-volt power head that will take any attachment that is listed as universal. So if it's a universal Ryobi, a universal Dewalt, a universal whatever, it will take that and you'll be able to use it, which is pretty awesome for most people. I have used this as a string trimmer only. I'm going to go through what I deem as what this is really great as after a year, and what it kind of isn't as great as. And we'll go through if you're looking at this at this point in time in the spring, what you might want to consider.\\n\\nThe Dewalt Flexvolt Universal attachment string trimmer is a 60-volt tool, so it will not take 20-volt batteries. You must be invested in the 60-volt platform. Not a big deal. Small battery, but it does weigh quite a bit because it's 3P. So the balance of this unit is off, although when you're hanging onto it a little differently, it will work a little bit better. With that said, it's a little bit shorter than many, so if you're taller, you might find yourself bending over a little bit more. It's a 15 to 17-inch swath down here on the head end. And the head that's down here, unfortunately, is not always as strong as some of the people using it. If you pound that head against the ground or against rocks, you'll find that it will break quite quickly. It is not expensive to replace with the Dewalt unit and it will take many other units that are out there. It is a speed close head, so you can easily put the line in it, but with that said, beat it against the ground a lot and you'll find yourself with parts laying all over the place. I've got a few friends with these and it happened to them quite quickly and you just have to learn if you're going to keep that head to be fairly gentle with it.\\n\\nThe second thing that maybe is a little bit annoying to many is going to be the safety. Now, this trigger is probably the most gas-like feeling trigger out there, but actually, it doesn't work anything like a gas trigger. It's a stepped trigger. But with that said, the safety on the top, you have to push this lever over and then hold this down, then you can pull the trigger. Otherwise, it's locked out. Great for throwing it in the back of a truck or something where you're piling it around other things, horrible for actually using it in the yard. Last downside to this is runtime. If you're really pushing this guy, runtimes are about 10 minutes with a 9 amp hour battery. That is like pushing it through solid, heavy grass. If you're just using it in normal household stuff, you can get 20 to 25 minutes out of it.\\n\\nThe reason why this one landed at my house and not in our contractor trailer or in our lawn mowing trailer is that runtime. Would have to carry two batteries in order to do the same amount of work I could do with a different machine with one battery. Is that because the motor is up top and we have a shaft that runs through? I don't know. There is a lot of power here, although the RPMs are lower. Low is going to be around 4,000 RPMs and high on this is going to max out about 5,800. But with that said, because of the 17-inch swath, you really get some great line speed going and this thing cuts like a beast.\\n\\nAnd secondly, it is butter smooth. You can use this thing all day if you wanted to and it feels great, it cuts great and there is zero vibrations felt up this grip. This grip is purely Dewalt and once you get over that safety, you will absolutely love it. The stepped trigger most people will get used to it, but when I say stepped trigger, it's not fully variable. It goes in different modes and just watch my finger here and listen.\\n\\nAs you get closer to the top, it feels more variable, but realistically it's just taking different points and bumping that motor up as it goes. That was not my finger just moving quickly through that. That was the steps as it goes through. Not a big deal. It's a little different than when if you're using gas and you're trying to use the different full variable speeds, it simply doesn't have it. It's just got the steps. Either way, this is one unit that I've kept the 0.080 line on, simply because it works great. A lot of people bump up to the 0.095, I can see why. I do on 99% of my stuff, but around home, I don't feel like I need it and this thing really has great power. And again, the runtime would suffer a little bit more if we upgraded to 0.095 line, so I keep it at 0.08.\\n\\nNow, kicker of what at home because of the short runtime, I can really do two to three cuts around my yard based off of one battery. I don't need to trim that much, but what ends up happening is the last cut, the third one mostly, the battery is mostly dead and I'll run out of battery. So half the time or a third, two-thirds, whatever, I go out and I'll run this on low only because I'm trying to conserve battery. And around the house on low only, it does awesome.\\n\\nIt's one of the few units that I actually use the low on because I was forced to because I was kind of a dummy and didn't pull out the battery and charge it up. Overall, this kit here, if you don't need super long runtime and if you want some good power and you have other attachments or you want to buy other attachments that are universal, an excellent buy. You will love the smoothness of it. You can easily pop a pin out here of that safety and the safety will be gone and it'll still be there, but the little flip part that's annoying will be gone and you will love using this trimmer. It's simply a great trimmer that probably could use a little bit more runtime or a little bit of uh I'd hate to say put a 12 amp hour or 15 amp hour battery on this and you'd get great runtime. You would. And the 12 amp hour battery isn't going to add much more weight, so why not? I think that would bump it up to the realm of where some of the other models are with lesser amp hour batteries.\\nBut this unit really has a lot to offer the homeowner who really wants to have a lot of power and a lot of smoothness. I mean, this really reminds me of my steel when I'm out cutting with it is just butter smooth and really enjoyable to use. So after one year, I would still highly recommend this unit. Be careful with the head. Now the replacing that head's 30 bucks, but just be careful with it, don't beat on it and if something happens and it's not letting out line, take a look at it and just don't continue beating on it.\\nThat's my take on this guy. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Please leave your comments below if you own this machine, if you have thoughts of buying it or anything else. It's always great to hear what other people have to say and a lot of people like to read that stuff and get your feedback also. We appreciate that.

       "{'transcript': \"Almost a year ago exactly, DeWalt came out with their Flex Volt Universal Attachment String Trimmer. Basically, that means this is a 60-volt power head that will take any attachment that is listed as universal. So, if it's a universal Ryobi, a universal DeWalt, a universal whatever, it will take that and you'll be able to use it, which is pretty awesome for most people. I have used this as a string trimmer only. I'm going to go through what I deem is what this is really great as after a year and what it kind of isn't as great as. And we'll go through if you're looking at this at this point in time in the spring, what you might want to consider. The DeWalt Flex Volt Universal Attachment String Trimmer is a 60-volt tool, so it will not take 20-volt batteries. You must be invested in the 60-volt platform. Not a big deal. Small battery, but it does weigh quite a bit because it's 3p. So, the balance of this unit is off. Although when you're hanging onto it a little differently, it will work a little bit better. With that said, it's a little bit shorter than many, so if you're taller, you might find yourself bending over a little bit more. It's a 15 to 17-inch swath down here on the head end. And the head that's down here, unfortunately, is not always as strong as some of the people using it. If you pound that head against the ground or against rocks, you'll find that it will break quite quickly. It is not expensive to replace with the DeWalt unit, and it will take many other units that are out there. It is a speed close head, so you can easily put the line in it, but with that said, beated against the ground a lot, and you'll find yourself with parts laying all over the place. I've got a few friends with these and it happened to them quite quickly and you just have to learn if you're going to keep that head to be fairly gentle with it. The second thing that maybe is a little bit annoying to many is going to be this safety. Now this trigger is probably the most gas-like feeling trigger out there, but actually it doesn't work anything like a gas trigger. It's a stepped trigger. But with that said, the safety on the top, you have to push this lever over and then hold this down, then you can pull the trigger. Otherwise, it's locked out. Great for throwing it in the back of a truck or something where you're piling it around other things, horrible for actually using it in the yard. Last downside to this is runtime. If you're really pushing this guy, runtimes are about 10 minutes with a 9 amp hour battery. That is like pushing it through solid heavy grass. If you're just using it in normal household stuff, you can get 20 to 25 minutes out of it. The reason why this one landed at my house and not in our contractor trailer or in our lawn mowing trailer is that runtime. Would have to carry two batteries in order to do the same amount of work I could do with a different machine with one battery. Is that because the motor is up top and we have a shaft that runs through? I don't know. There is a lot of power here, although the RPMs are lower. Low is going to be around 4,000 RPMs and high on this is going to max out about 5,800. But with that said, because of the 17-inch swath, you really get some great line speed going and this thing cuts like a beast. And secondly, it is butter smooth. You can use this thing all day if you wanted to and it feels great, it cuts great, and there is zero vibrations felt up this grip. This grip is purely DeWalt and once you get over that safety, you will absolutely love it. The step trigger, most people will get used to it, but when I say step trigger, it's not fully variable. It goes in different modes and just watch my finger here and listen. As you get closer to the top, it feels more variable, but realistically it's just taking different points and bumping that motor up as it goes. That was not my finger just moving quickly through that. That was the steps as it goes through. Not a big deal. It's a little different than when if you're using gas and you're trying to use the different full variable speeds, simply doesn't have it. It's just got the steps. Either way, this is one unit that I've kept the 0.080 line on simply because it works great. A lot of people bump up to the 0.095, I can see why. I do 99% of my stuff, but around home, I don't feel like I need it. And this thing really has great power. And again, the runtime would suffer a little bit more if we upgraded to 0.095 line. So, I keep it at 0.080. Now, kicker of what at home, because of the short runtime, I I can really do two to three cuts around my yard based off of one battery. I don't need to trim that much, but what ends up happening is the last cut, the third one mostly, the battery's mostly dead and I'll run out of battery. So, half the time or a third, two-thirds, whatever, I go out and I'll run this on low only because I'm trying to conserve battery. And around the house on low only, it does awesome. It's one of the few units that I actually use the low on because I was forced to because I'm kind of a dummy and didn't pull out the battery and charge it up. Overall, this kit here, if you don't need super long runtime and if you want some good power and you have other attachments or you want to buy other attachments that are universal, an excellent buy. You will love the smoothness of it. You can easily pop a pin out here of that safety and the safety will be gone and it'll still be there, but the little flip part that's annoying will be gone and you will love using this trimmer. Simply a great trimmer that probably could use a little bit more runtime or a little bit of uh I'd hate to say put a 12 amp hour or 15 amp hour battery on this and you'd get great runtime. You would. And the 12 amp hour battery isn't going to add much more weight, so why not? I think that would bump it up to the realm of where some of the other models are with lesser amp hour batteries. But this unit really has a lot to offer the homeowner who really wants to have a lot of power and a lot of smoothness. I mean, this really reminds me of my steel when I'm out cutting with it. It is just butter smooth and really enjoyable to use. So, after one year, I would still highly recommend this unit. Be careful with the head. Now the replacing that head's 30 bucks, but just be careful with it. Don't beat on it and if something happens and it's not letting out line, take a look at it and just don't continue beating on it. That's my take on this guy. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Please leave your comments below if you own this machine, if you have thoughts of buying it or anything else. It's always great to hear what other people have to say and a lot of people like to read that stuff and get your feedback also. We appreciate that. Give us a like on this video.

       " 'summary': \"The DeWalt Flex Volt Universal Attachment String Trimmer, a 60-volt tool, is praised for being awesome, smooth, and powerful, reminding the reviewer of a steel. It features a 15 to 17-inch swath and can take universal attachments. The reviewer highlights that this trimmer's balance is off, it's shorter than many, and it's important to be gentle with the head to avoid breakage. The step trigger, which is a stepped trigger, and safety feature are noted as potential annoyances for some. While the trimmer cuts like a beast with zero vibrations, the runtime is about 10 minutes with a 9 amp hour battery. Around the house, the unit does awesome on low only. Despite these drawbacks, the reviewer recommends the unit, particularly for homeowners seeking power and smoothness, with the recommendation to use the 0.080 line and consider upgrading to a 12 or 15 amp hour battery for longer runtime.\",\n",
