0,"Almost a year ago exactly, Dewalt came out with their Flexvolt Universal Attachment String Trimmer. Basically, that means this is a 60-volt power head that will take any attachment that is listed as universal. So, if it's a universal Ryobi, a universal Dewalt, a universal whatever, it will take that and you'll be able to use it, which is pretty awesome for most people. I have used this as a string trimmer only. I'm going to go through what I deem as what this is really great as after a year and what it kind of isn't as great as. And we'll go through if you're looking at this at this point in time in the spring, what you might want to consider. The Dewalt Flexvolt Universal Attachment String Trimmer is a 60-volt tool, so it will not take 20-volt batteries. You must be invested in the 60-volt platform. Not a big deal, small battery, but it does weigh quite a bit because it's 3P. So, the balance of this unit is off. Although when you're hanging onto it a little differently, it will work a little bit better. With that said, it's a little bit shorter than many, so if you're taller, you might find yourself bending over a little bit more. It's a 15 to 17-inch swath down here on the head end, and the head that's down here unfortunately is not always as strong as some of the people using it. If you pound that head against the ground or against rocks, you'll find that it will break quite quickly. It is not expensive to replace with the Dewalt unit, and it will take many other units that are out there. It is a speed-close head, so you can easily put the line in it, but with that said, beat it against the ground a lot, and you'll find yourself with parts laying all over the place. I've got a few friends with these and it happened to them quite quickly and you just have to learn if you're going to keep that head to be fairly gentle with it. The second thing that maybe is a little bit annoying to many is going to be this safety. Now, this trigger is probably the most gas-like feeling trigger out there, but actually it doesn't work anything like a gas trigger. It's a stepped trigger. But with that said, the safety on the top, you have to push this lever over and then hold this down, then you can pull the trigger. Otherwise, it's locked out. Great for throwing it in the back of a truck or something where you're piling it around other things. Horrible for actually using it in the yard. Last downside to this is runtime. If you're really pushing this guy, runtimes are about 10 minutes with a 9 amp hour battery. That is like pushing it through solid heavy grass. If you're just using it in normal household stuff, you can get 20 to 25 minutes out of it. The reason why this one landed at my house and not in our contractor trailer or in our lawn mowing trailer is that runtime. Would have to carry two batteries in order to do the same amount of work I could do with a different machine with one battery. Is that because the motor is up top and we have a shaft that runs through? I don't know. There is a lot of power here, although the RPMs are lower. Low is going to be around 4,000 RPMs and high on this is going to max out about 5,800. But with that said, because of the 17-inch swath, you really get some great line speed going and this thing cuts like a beast. And secondly, it is butter smooth. You can use this thing all day if you wanted to and it feels great, it cuts great and there is zero vibrations felt up this grip. This grip is purely Dewalt, and once you get over that safety, you will absolutely love it. The step trigger most people will get used to it, but when I say step trigger, it's not fully variable. It goes in different modes. And just watch my finger here and listen. As you get closer to the top, it feels more variable, but realistically, it's just taking different points and bumping that motor up as it goes. That was not my finger just moving quickly through that. That was the steps as it goes through. Not a big deal. It's a little different than if you're using gas and you're trying to use the different full variable speeds. It simply doesn't have it. It's just got the steps. Either way, this is one unit that I've kept the 0.080 line on simply because it works great. A lot of people bump up to the 0.095. I can see why. I do 99% of my stuff, but around home, I don't feel like I need it and this thing really has great power. And again, the runtime would suffer a little bit more if we upgraded to 0.095 line, so I keep it at 0.08. Now, kicker of what at home because of the short runtime, I don't I can really do two to three cuts around my yard based off of one battery. I don't need to trim that much, but what ends up happening is the last cut, the third one mostly, the battery is mostly dead and I'll run out of battery. So, half the time or a third, two-thirds, whatever, I go out and I'll run this on low only because I'm trying to conserve battery. And around the house on low only, it does awesome. It's one of the few units that I actually use the low on because I was forced to because I was kind of a dummy and didn't pull out the battery and charge it up. Overall, this kit here, if you don't need super long runtime and if you want some good power and you have other attachments or you want to buy other attachments that are universal, an excellent buy. You will love the smoothness of it. You can easily pop a pin out here of that safety and the safety will be gone and it'll still be there, but the little flip part that's annoying will be gone and you will love using this trimmer. It's simply a great trimmer that probably could use a little bit more runtime or a little bit of I'd hate to say put a 12 amp hour or 15 amp hour battery on this and you'd get great runtime. You would. And the 12 amp hour battery isn't going to add much more weight, so why not? I think that would bump it up to the realm of where some of the other models are with lesser amp hour batteries. But this unit really has a lot to offer the homeowner who really wants to have a lot of power and a lot of smoothness. I mean, this really reminds me of my steel when I'm out cutting with it is just butter smooth and really enjoyable to use. So, after one year, I would still highly recommend this unit. Be careful with the head. Now, the replacing that head's 30 bucks, but just be careful with it, don't beat on it and if something happens and it's not letting out line, take a look at it. And just don't continue beating on it. That's my take on this guy. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Please leave your comments below. If you own this machine, if you have thoughts of buying it or anything else, it's always great to hear what other people have to say and a lot of people like to read that stuff and get your feedback also.

Have a great day.","In this video, the presenter reviews the Dewalt Flexvolt Universal Attachment String Trimmer after a year of use. He notes that the trimmer requires a 60-volt battery and, while powerful, has a shorter runtime of about 10 minutes under heavy use, extending to 20-25 minutes for normal household tasks with a 9 amp hour battery. The trimmer's balance is off, and its length may be too short for taller individuals. He praises the smooth operation, the 15-17 inch swath, and the absence of vibrations. A major downside is the head's fragility when used against hard surfaces. The safety mechanism can be annoying, and the step trigger is not fully variable. He recommends using a 0.080 line for better performance and conserving battery by using the low setting around the house. Overall, the presenter recommends the trimmer for homeowners seeking power and smoothness, provided they are mindful of the runtime and head durability.","{'positives': [{'sentiment': 'Smooth operation and lack of vibrations', 'count': 3}, {'sentiment': 'Good power', 'count': 3}, {'sentiment': 'Great cutting performance', 'count': 2}, {'sentiment': 'Excellent buy for homeowners', 'count': 2}, {'sentiment': 'Speed-close head for easy line replacement', 'count': 1}, {'sentiment': 'Great line speed with 17-inch swath', 'count': 1}], 'negatives': [{'sentiment': 'Short runtime (10 minutes under heavy use)', 'count': 4}, {'sentiment': 'Head is fragile and breaks easily against hard surfaces', 'count': 3}, {'sentiment': 'Balance of the unit is off', 'count': 1}, {'sentiment': 'May be too short for taller individuals', 'count': 1}, {'sentiment': 'Safety mechanism is annoying', 'count': 1}, {'sentiment': 'Step trigger is not fully variable', 'count': 1}]}"
